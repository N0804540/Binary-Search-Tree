# Binary-Search-Tree

Language: C++

This small project revolves around the implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure.

An additional automated testing class is featured alongside to confirm the functionality of the BST's functions.

The tests were created using the BOOST testing framework for C++. This was a solo project, and I created both the BST structure as well as the specific BOOST test implementations (although the test suite itself can be credited to the BOOST C++ library project (https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_77_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html)).
